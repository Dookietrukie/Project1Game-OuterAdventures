        <p>Whoa, you open your eyes and find yourself in a freaky forest. The trees are towering and there's no path in
            sight. You can't remember how you got here, but something tells you that you're not in your usual neck of
            the woods. You can hear strange noises coming from all around, and you're pretty sure that there's something
            lurking in the shadows. Can you find your way out of this crazy place and uncover its secrets?</p>
