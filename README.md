## Playing the Game

The game is pretty simple to play. The player fights enemies by attacking them with different skills. There are four skills available: ATTACK, SPELL, DEFENSE, and POTION.

* **ATTACK**: Attacks the enemy with the player's strength.
* **SPELL**: Casts a fireball at the enemy with the player's knowledge.
* **DEFENSE**: Increases the player's defense.
* **POTION**: Restores the player's health.

To attack the enemy, click on the desired skill button. The enemy will then attack the player, and the game will continue until either the player or the enemy has been defeated.

## Game Mechanics

The game is turn-based, meaning the player attacks first and then the enemy attacks. The player's attack strength is determined by their selected skill and their stats. The enemy's stats are randomly generated at the start of each new enemy battle.

If the enemy's health drops to zero or less, the player will win the battle and gain additional stats. A new enemy will spawn with increased stats, and the game will continue.

If the player's health drops to zero or less, the game will end and the player will lose.

This game is a simple but fun game that can be played by anyone. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
